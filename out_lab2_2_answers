Q1: (cin only) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why
Answer Q1: I entered 10 and the flag was false, but when I entered 4.5 it still sets the flag to false and it extracts the value 4, 
 and it continues to loop without accepting any other values

Q2: (cin + fail+ignore) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why.
Answer Q2: I entered 10 and it set the flag to false, then I entered 4.5 and it set the flag to false but it showed that .5 was unread in the buffer, 
 for abc and a it sets the flag to true and explains that those are not integers

Q3: Is the problem of reading an integer value solved? Explain your reasoning.
Answer Q3: No because when 4.5 was read, it still sets the flag to be false and extracted 4 without saying 4.5 is not an integer
